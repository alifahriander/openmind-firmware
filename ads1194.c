 * This method assumes nothing else than the ADS is on the spi when the !CS pin of the ADS is
 * pulled low. If you want to change this, you will have to pull it low each time a command or
 * data is sent/to be received to/from the ADS.

 * This method is run right at the startup of the avr.

 * For future boards the cksel input should also be considered here. On the

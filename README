First off: This is still work in progress, so don't rely on it.

In fact, this stuff works -- it sends the measured values via SPI (for now).
More to come. The ADS1194/ADS1XXX driver (with a little modding it is easily
usable for other TI ADCs) does work quite well and I consider that part as
'final'.
